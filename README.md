- **日常物理 (Everyday Physics)** – A fun and interactive app for learning basic physics concepts.
- **動体視力道場 (Dynamic Visual Acuity Dojo)** – A training app to improve dynamic visual acuity skills, perfect for athletes and gamers alike.

All of these apps are currently available and continue to serve users every day.

### 🌱 Always Learning
I’m always looking to improve my skills, especially in:
- **iOS development** using Swift and Firebase.
- **Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on practical applications and problem-solving.

### 🎯 Professional Goals
I aim to become proficient in building cutting-edge technologies, both in mobile applications and AI solutions, and to continue creating projects that benefit and inspire people.

### 🎉 Hobbies & Interests
